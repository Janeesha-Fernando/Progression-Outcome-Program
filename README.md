# Progression-Outcome-Program
The program required by the university in Python language should predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic year based on the volume of credit at each level. 
The program should prompt for the number of credits at pass, defer, and fail and display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student, such as progress, trailing, module retriever, or exclude. 
It should display 'Integer required' if a credit input is the wrong data type, 'Out of range' if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120, and 'Total incorrect' if the total of the pass, defer, and fail credits is not 120. 
The program should also include a loop to allow a staff member to predict progression outcomes for multiple students and a histogram to display the number of students for each progression category and the total number of students.
